A policy is an entity that contains permissions and is attached to an identity or resource.

Permissions are based on the granularity of individual API calls to the different AWS services.

- Identity-based policies
    - Attached to principal entities (users, groups, and roles)
    - Types:
        - Managed policies (have their own ARN)
            - AWS managed policies
            - Customer managed policies
        - Inline policies
- Resource-based policies
    - All resource-based policies are inline policies

Defining policies in CloudFormation: use the visual editor (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies$new?step=edit) to define the policy, display the generated JSON, and translate it to YAML.

If you want to write policies directly in JSON, the reference is here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html

As a best practice, break up policies by resource type
